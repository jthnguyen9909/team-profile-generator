## Description

This project is an application I created using Inquirer for user input and Jest for test driven development, in order for a user to dynamically create a webpage that displays a team's info as well as each member's information dependent on their role in the team. This code was created with the use of test driven development in mind, and thus will contain fewer errors and bugs. The directory is also structured in order for users to be able to access cleaner and more intuitive routing for this code.

## Usage

After the user installs the necessary dependencies by running the command 'npm i' in the terminal, the user will then be prompted by Inquirer what kind of employee they would like to add to the webpage. After that, they will be prompted questions that are specific to that role and if they would like to add any other employees. If the user is done, they can choose the 'None' option when asked what kind of employee they would like to add, and the program will generate a new HTML called team.html in the dist folder.
